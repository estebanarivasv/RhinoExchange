# Rhino Exchange

Live demo: https://rhino-exchange-7d650.web.app/dashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4.

It is about a basic webapp that works with [Coingecko-API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). The user can access to its wallets information and also make transactions such as buying other cryptocurrencies.

# Not accomplished requirements - What's left to do?

- Responsive Layout in all components except Header
- Ability to modify and edit transactions

## Angular CLI Commands

- Development server: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Code scaffolding: Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
- Build: Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- Running unit tests: Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Running end-to-end tests: Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
